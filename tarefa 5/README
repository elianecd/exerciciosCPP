Statistical informations about an array
========================================
Writen by: Eliane Dahab

This program identifies from an array which value is the lowest and the highest.
Calculates as well the average of the array and the variance.
For last, counts how many values are negative, zero and positive.

The Output shows the following order:
lowest, highest, average, variance, negative, zero and positive.

Compile: g++ -Wall ex5a.cc –o ex5a
Run: ex5a
Input: An array of 6 numbers
e.g. 0 9 3 -2 -8 -9

        The variance is calculated as follows:((x1-AVG)2+ (x2-AVG)2+…+(xN-AVG)2)/N

Output: -9 9 -1 38.5 3 1 2

Identifying in an array the cell that is divided by and divides
========================================
Writen by: Eliane Dahab, id = 338038839, login = elianech

This program identifies from an array which cell follows the conditions:

- is divided by the values of the cells before him, without remainder;
- divides the values of the cells after him, without remainder.

Compile: g++ -Wall ex5b.cc –o ex5b
Run: ex5b
Input: An array of 6 numbers
e.g. 15 20 30 60 120 180

Output: 3 Because is the index of the cell that follows the conditions.

This program first runs on readInput function through all the N cells in the array.
This means that the program runs N times.
However, the function findFirstDivisorDivider runs all the N cells in the array.
So for each cell he runs again with another function.
Thus, the program runs N _ N-1 _ N-2 _ N-3 _...= N^2, this is N \* N.
(Calculating the sum of all the actions through arithmetic progression math serie).

Drawing an histogram
========================================
Writen by: Eliane Dahab, id = 338038839, login = elianech

This program counts from a big array the following topics:

- how many numbers are primes;
- how many numbers are divided by 2;
- how many numbers are divided by 3;
- how many numbers are divided by 4;
- how many numbers are divided by 5;
- how many numbers are divided by 6;

The values of the array are random values between a low and higher numbers.
The functions to create and draw the histogram are part of other programs.
Thus, in this program we just "call" those functions to print the histogram.
Each topic mentioned above represents each column of the histogram.
The array is compound by 200 cells.

Compile: g++ -Wall ex5c.cc –o ex5c
Run: ex5c
Input: Low and high numbers
e.g., 7 562

Output: A histogram
