Simple recursions
========================================
Writen by: Eliane Dahab

This program does simple recursion operations from a simple array:

1. Enters values from the user into the array;
2. Sums all the values of the array and shows the result of the sum;
3. Bubble sort the array to put all the values in a crescent order;
4. Searches inside the array for the wanted number that the user enters,
   but first the array must be bubbled sorted, if it not, will print "Error",
   and then will "1" if the number is found or "0" if it is not;
5. Checks whether the array is an arithmetic progression;
6. Shows the values of the array from beginning to the end;
7. Shows the values of the array from end to the beginning;
8. Starting from the third cell, the program checks if the current cell
   represents the sum of the values of the 2 cells before him.
   The program will print "1" if the cell is the sum of the 2 cells before him,
   or will print "0" if the cell is not the sum;
9. Checks if the array is palindrome;
10. Counts how many series are in the array, crescent and decrescent order;
11. Finds the maximum value of the sub-array.
    The user enters the number of the first and last cell of the sub-array.
12. Shows the prime numbers found in the array according to the order of the array;
13. Closes the program.
    The size of the array is up to 10 cells.

Compile: g++ -Wall ex8a.cc â€“o ex8a
Run: ex8a
Input: 1 //To order the program to fill the array with the input
An array;
The number that represents the selected operation.
e.g. 1
5 7 2 3 9 2 1 7 5 6
3 //the selected operation

Output: 1 2 2 3 5 5 6 7 7 9 //The array bubbled sorted
