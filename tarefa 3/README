Counting the amount of numbers from a serie until zero
========================================
Writen by: Eliane Dahab

This program calculates from a serie the amount of numbers, their average, the amount of positive and negative numbers.
The moment that the program identifies the zero in the serie, he will stop running and calculates all the aspects of all the numbers before him.
The average is made by the sum of all numbers (until zero) and divided by their amount.

Compile: g++ -Wall ex3a.cc –o ex3a
Run: ex3a
Input: A serie of numbers with zero
e.g. 5 -9 12 76 -54 0 23 14 for the program to count all the numbers until zero

Output: 5 6 This first line shows the amount of all numbers before zero and their average.
3 2 This second line shows the quantity of positive and negative numbers until zero.

Calculating the pair of numbers from 1 to 1000
========================================
Writen by: Eliane Dahab, id = 338038839, login = elianech

This program verifies which pair of numbers from 1 to 1000 that the sum of two squared numbers is equal to a third power of any number.
And the sum of those two numbers in the third power each, is equal to a square of any number.
In other words, x^2 + y^2 = num1^3 AND x^3 + y^3 = num2^2.

Compile: g++ -Wall ex3b.cc –o ex3b
Run: ex3b
Input: None

Output: 2 2
128 128

Verifying the ID number
========================================
Writen by: Eliane Dahab, id = 338038839, login = elianech

This program verifies whether an ID number is valid or not.

Compile: g++ -Wall ex3c.cc –o ex3c
Run: ex3c
Input: ID number
e.g., 3862877 for the following calculations:

        First is to calculate the amount of the digits of an ID number, it must have the minimum of 6 digits and maximum of 9.

        Second is to multiply by 2 the digits that are in even positions and if the result got 2 digits, need to sum those 2 digits.

        The next is to sum all the digits and then it must be divided by 10 without rest to be considered as a valid ID number.

        If the ID number is wrong or does not fit the permitted digits, the program will print 0.

Output: 1
