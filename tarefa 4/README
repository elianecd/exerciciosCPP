Counting from an array how many cells is divided by the cell before him
========================================
Writen by: Eliane Dahab

This program calculates from an array which cell is divisible by the cell before him and also divides the cell after him.
And then counts how many cells that matches those conditions.
The divisions are done through the values of the respective cells and there can be no remainder.

Compile: g++ -Wall ex4a.cc –o ex4a
Run: ex4a
Input: An array of 6 numbers
e.g. 3 5 10 20 51 73

Output: 1 The program counted one because only this cell with value 10 is divisible by 5 and divides 20 without remainder.

Identifying the small array inside the big array
========================================
Writen by: Eliane Dahab, id = 338038839, login = elianech

This program checks whether the small array is found inside of the big array in his correct order.
The small array is compound by 3 cells and the big array by 9 cells.

Compile: g++ -Wall ex4b.cc –o ex4b
Run: ex4b
Input: The small array
e.g. 5 9 7

       The big array
       e.g. 3 4 5 5 9 7 0 4 1

Output: 3 Because is from the cell of position 3 that is found the beginning of the small array inside of the big array.

Identifying a loop inside of the array
========================================
Writen by: Eliane Dahab, id = 338038839, login = elianech

This program identifies whether there is a loop inside of the array.
The array is compound by 8 cells.
The loop happens when the value of a cell points to the position of another cell and so on, until the last cell in the series indicates the first cell of the loop.

Compile: g++ -Wall ex4c.cc –o ex4c
Run: ex4c
Input: An array
e.g., 2 3 5 99 43 7 74 0 for the following calculations:

        The first cell (number 0) points to the cell number 2;
        The cell number 2 points to the cell number 5;
        The cell number 5 points to the cell number 7;
        The cell number 7 points to the cell number 0;
        The last cell pointed back to the first cell, creating a loop.


Output: 0 2 5 7 Represents the positions of the cells that are forming a loop.
