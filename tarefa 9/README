Pattern matching
========================================
Writen by: Eliane Dahab, id = 338038839, login = elianech

This program receives 2 strings from the user.
Every string is up to 50 characters each.
The first string is called string and the second string is called pattern.
The program checks whether the string matches with the pattern.
The conditions to check the match are:

- For every normal character that is not "\*" or "?" in the pattern
  fits only if the character is the same in the string;
- For each "?" character in the pattern, matches for each individual
  character in the string;
- For the "\*" character in the pattern, may matches zero or more characters
  in the string.
  In the end, the program will print 1 if the 2 strings match or 0 for no match.

Compile: g++ -Wall ex9b.cc –o ex9b
Run: ex9b
Input: The 2 strings
e.g. abcd //This the string
ab?? //This is the pattern

Output: 1

Gold bars
========================================
Writen by: Eliane Dahab, id = 338038839, login = elianech

This program receives from the user an array of 5 numbers.
Every number of the array represents the weigh of each gold bars.
So the program divides the 5 gold bars equally between 2 goldsmiths.
Meaning, each of them will get the exactly same weigh of gold in the division.
If the division won't be equal between the 2 goldsmiths, the program will
print: "Cannot divide".
If the division can be equal, will be printed in separated lines what each
goldsmith will get of the total of the gold bars.

Compile: g++ -Wall ex9c.cc –o ex9c
Run: ex9c
Input: The 5 gold bars //The array of 5 numbers
e.g., 1 1 2 4 2 //The total weigh of the gold bars is 10

Output: 1 2 2 //The first goldsmith gets 3 bars, total weigh is 5.
1 4 //The second goldsmith gets 2 bars, total weigh is also 5.
