========================================
Writen by: Eliane Dahab

This program calculates the difference between numbers.

Compile: g++ -Wall ex1a.cc –o ex1a
Run: ex1a
Input: 	Three random numbers for the operation of difference
        e.g. 35 -18 0 for the operation: 35 - 35, 35 - (-18), 35 - 0

Output: The difference between the first number with the other two numbers.

Calculating the area and the perimeter of a triangle
========================================
Writen by: Eliane Dahab, id = 338038839, login = elianech

This program solves a square root of the area using the Heron's formula and calculates the perimeter of a triangle

Compile: g++ -Wall ex1b.cc –o ex1b
Run: ex1b
Input: The three sides of a triangle
         e.g., 5 5 5 

         First to calculate the side used in the Heron's formula
          side = (side1 + side2 + side3) / 2;

         And then calculating the area of the triangle through Heron's formula 
          area = sqrt (side * (side - side1) * (side - side2) * (side - side3));

         For the last, calculating the perimeter of the triangle
          perimeter = side * 2;

Output: The area and the perimeter of the triangle.

Calculating the final grade of the course of the form:
Assignment 1 (targil 1) compounds 10% of the final grade
Assignment 2 (targil 2) compounds 20% of the final grade
Exam compounds 70% of the final grade
========================================

This program calculates the final grade of the course

Compile: g++ -Wall ex1c.cc –o ex1c
Run: ex1c
Input: The grades of the assignments and the exam
         e.g., 45 78 80 for the sum of all the grades to compound the final grade of the course

         num1 = 45 , num2 = 78 , num3 = 80
         targil1 = (num1 * 0.1);
         targil2 = (num2 * 0.2);
         exam = (num3 * 0.7);

         finalgrade = targil1 + targil2 + exam;

Output: The final grade calculating according to the percentage of the other grades.
